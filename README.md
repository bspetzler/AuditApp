# Audit App MVP Project Proposal

Create a PASS/FAIL checklist for Quality to check the relevent processes at different locations, displayed as a grid checklist.
Each checklist is saved to a server with a time stamp.
Collected data can be graphed using a selection of multiple different variables.
    Variables include time (with range), category/categories, location/locations.

## Problem

It's difficult to do simple pass fail/audits and log the data accessibly for analysis.
